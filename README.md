## About the project :monocle_face:	

Our first ever F&C challenge for the next couple of days was to build an agency website for our project team.

We aimed to meet potential client needs by including: 

- An introduction to our agency
- Information about each member of our team
- And a way to get in touch if they are interested in working with us! :handshake:

> Additionally, we wanted to focus on the responsiveness and accessibility of our code whilst keeping it clean! :dizzy:
